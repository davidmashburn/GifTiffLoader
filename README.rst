GifTiffLoader is a module to automatically load multi-dimensional Tiff and Gif
files and file sequences as numpy arrays using PIL.

Specifically, it is designed to deal with 8-bit and 16-bit images typically
used as the standard formats for microscope images.  It is also designed to
deal with image stacks (Animated Gifs and Multi-page Tiffs) and image sequences
(both 3D and 4D sequences).

GifTiffLoader also relies on wxPython and FilenameSort.

Sponsored by the NSF, NIH, and HFSP through the Shane Hutson Laboratory, part of
